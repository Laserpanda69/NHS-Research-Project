AThermodynamic Analysis of Neonatal Incubators

 1 Executive Summary
 Our project brief set our team a series of five questions related to the use of hospital incubators, primarily focused on the GI
 Giraffe incubator:
 1. How BABYMODE/SERVOMODEadjuststhe temperature?
 2. How NHSdoctors or nurses should be adjusting the temperature when using AIR MODE?
 3. How much heat loss is happening when one or more side (porthole) doors are opened? What is the impact with duration
 of door opening?
 4. What is the efficacy of “AIR BOOST” when it is activated?
 5. What is the impact of humidity on the temperature control?
 In order to evaluate these questions, a series of seven thermocouples and two humidity meters were placed throughout
 both the GI Giraffe incubator and an associated acrylic model. The ‘air mode’, ’air boost’ and ‘servo mode’ incubator
 settings were all tested under varying temperature and humidity conditions to determine some conclusions about them.
 Experiments were conducted to measure the ability of the incubators in maintaining the temperature and humidity in
 ‘air mode’, ‘air boost’ and ‘servo mode’, each for 20-minute intervals. This provided a series of results summarised below:
 Servo mode is mostly used in the first two weeks of a neonatal baby’s life, when they are not developed enough to
 maintain their own body temperature. The servo mode experiments proved that the incubator responds proportionately to
 the temperature difference between the baby’s skin and the set temperature of the incubator. As this temperature difference
 increases, the speed of the temperature response and the magnitude of the response increase too. The incubator was effective
 at both increasing and decreasing the inside temperature. However, it was found to be more effective at increasing the
 temperature than decreasing it. One of the key findings was that temperatures in different locations of the incubator could
 be up to 5◦C different, causing the temperature to become too high in certain locations.
 Air mode is used in the later stages of a neonatal baby’s life when they are more thermally stable. During air mode
 experiments, the most significant source of heat loss was through the end of the incubator. This is likely due the heat loss
 through the multiple small openings at the end of the incubator. Furthermore, when the portholes are open, the rate of
 humidity decrease was significant within the first minute of opening the portholes.
 For air mode, the rate of temperature decrease for the model baby when the porthole doors were open was negligible at
 the rate of (-1.03 ± 0.06) ×10−3◦Cs−1 at a high humidity setting. However, despite setting the target temperature of the
 incubator to 37.0◦C, the temperature of the baby remained at a critical temperature of approximately 35◦C which poses a
 significant health risk of hypothermia. Therefore, air mode was unable to increase the temperature of the baby to the target
 temperature and a higher target temperature is recommended when the portholes need to be opened.
 At a lower humidity setting, the effect of heat loss during air mode was slightly reduced, reaching a higher minimum
 temperature than when the same experiment was conducted in a higher humidity setting. The air from the heater was able
 to escape less through the porthole door openings and contribute more towards the convection currents in the incubator.
 However, this had negligible effect on the temperature of the baby as the temperature continued to decrease at a rate of
 (-1.53 ± 0.01) ×10−4◦Cs−1. Although this rate is negligible, the temperature of the model of the baby was unable to reach
 the target temperature.
 Air boost mode is designed to retain heat while portholes are open. Air boost was found to decrease the humidity inside
 the incubator more than in air mode. The relative humidity reached a low of 47% in air mode during a 20-minute data set
 with 4 portholes open, whereas an equivalent set of data for air boost caused the humidity to drop to 43%. However, there is
 evidence to suggest that air boost does maintain temperature inside the incubator more efficiently than air mode- the Heat
 Sensor thermocouple experienced a low of 36.5◦C in a 20-minute period with 4 portholes open in air mode, whereas air
 boost saw a low of 37.5◦C, suggesting better heat retention.
 Several improvements to the incubators were devised. These improvements aimed to resolve two problems: the servo
 mode temperature probe falling off the baby, and the rapid heat and humidity loss when portholes are opened for medical
 interaction. Intending to decrease heat and humidity loss, a design involving rubber sleeves attaching to the portholes was
 trialled, with experimental evidence indicating a significant increase in humidity retention. For the unmodified incubator,
 the smallest temperature decreases were greater than 10.7◦C, however in the ’sleeve-modified trials’, the largest drop was
 only 10.56 ± 0.06◦C. Hence the greatest drop in temperature with the sleeves was equal to the smallest drop without them,
 suggesting significant improvement.
